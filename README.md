## General info
This serves as the Data Management Backbone for our ADSDB project. Each zone is represented by a distinct folder, 
with each folder housing the relevant Python script. When Operations.py is executed, it seamlessly runs all the 
distinct zones and stores their output files in the /Landing/Persistent directory.
